# machine_learning_projects
I created this repo to follow an online course I took from Udemy, [Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/). <br /> 
<br /> 
I wrote my code first after seeing the data and seeing what method I'm learning today, and I watched the learning videos if I got stuck. Then I make corresponding changes to make those files handy for future coding use.<br />  
Follow along with my machine learning journey! <br />
